## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Positions


### What I learned

First Html i just know from now how to make in icons for my Web site 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('YayyyyyyðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

My future PLans is to be more good in css{Flex-Box and Grid-Box}
na why not to learn more in Js
